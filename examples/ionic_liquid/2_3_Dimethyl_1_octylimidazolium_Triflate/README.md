We are going to simulate 2_3_Dimethyl_1_octylimidazolium_Triflate 
Which has been experimentally measured here:
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jp051673c

We should be able to use parameters for the triflate ion here:
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp0476545

Which has been formualted to be compatible with OPLS-AA and/or AMBER
